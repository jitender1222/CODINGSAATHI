        <p>
          Einstein is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists
          of the 20th century. His work has had a major impact on our
          understanding of the universe and has led to many technological
          advancements, including the development of nuclear energy and the
          creation of the atomic bomb. Einstein's theories have also influenced
          many areas outside of physics, including philosophy, literature, and
          popular culture.
